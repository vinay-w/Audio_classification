I worked with the Ultra Sound Data Set, which has over 8000 audio recordings broken down into ten classifications. 
After training the Sequential model, my accuracy was 76%. 
The most crucial stage in any classification process is feature extraction, which enables a machine to recognise and categorise various objects 
and to extract features from audio recordings. 
Thus, I utilised the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients which is very efficient in case of audio classification
